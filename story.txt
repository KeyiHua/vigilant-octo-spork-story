Bob is a dog raised by Wills. They live in California. They are very good friends of each other.

Two days ago Willis decided to take Bob for a walk in the park, but they had a rough encounter.

A coyote appeared in the path ahead of them. Unfortunately, it was dark and they did not notice the
coyote right away.

It was a good thing that Bob was a tough dog and he drove the coyote away.

Wills thinks that Bob is a smart and brave dog.
